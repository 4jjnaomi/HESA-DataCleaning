# COMP0035 2023-24 Coursework

This repository contains the code and material generated for the two courseworks I produced for the module COMP0035.

The first coursework, found under the [coursework1](/src/coursework1/) folder, involved understanding, cleaning and preparing the dataset for the app. The file [data](/src/coursework1/data.py) contains the code used to turn [dataset.csv](/src/coursework1/dataset/dataset.csv) into [dataset_prepared.csv](/src/coursework1/dataset/dataset_prepared.csv).

Other aspects and explanation of the coursework can be seen in [the pdf explaning the coursewrk](/src/coursework1/coursework1.pdf).

The [second coursework](/src/coursework2/coursework2.pdf) involved carrying out product management activities including eliciting requirements, creating wireframes, making class diagrams and designing the database for the data app I was going to create.
